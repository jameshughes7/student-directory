# Student-directory #

The student directory script allows you to manager the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

During the Pre-Course at Makers Academy, I built a terminal based student director from scratch. It was built using Ruby alone and was designed for the script to be invoked from the command line. The script allowed for student directory to be viewed, added to, saved to a csv file and loaded from that csv file.
